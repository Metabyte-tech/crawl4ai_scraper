{"status":"success","response":"As a technical documentation expert, my goal is to provide accurate and detailed step-by-step instructions on using Web Assembly (WASM) in Iroha. Here's the rewritten content:\n\n**Working with WASM**\n\nIroha supports the use of WebAssembly (WASM) for deploying smart contracts. This allows developers to write code in languages like Rust, C++, or Go, and then compile it to WASM, which can be executed by the Iroha network.\n\n### Step 1: Compile Your Code to WASM\n\nTo use WASM in Iroha, you'll need to compile your code to WASM. You can do this using a compiler like `wasm-pack` or `rustc`.\n\nFor example, if you're writing a smart contract in Rust, you can use the following command:\n```bash\n$ rustc --target=wasm32-unknown-unknown my_contract.rs -o my_contract.wasm\n```\nThis will compile your Rust code to WASM and output a file named `my_contract.wasm`.\n\n### Step 2: Deploy Your WASM Code to Iroha\n\nOnce you have compiled your code to WASM, you can deploy it to the Iroha network using the `iroha` command-line tool.\n\nFor example:\n```bash\n$ iroha deploy --wasm my_contract.wasm\n```\nThis will deploy your WASM code to the Iroha network and create a new smart contract instance.\n\n### Step 3: Interact with Your Smart Contract\n\nOnce your smart contract is deployed, you can interact with it using the `iroha` command-line tool. For example:\n```bash\n$ iroha query --contract my_contract --function my_function\n```\nThis will execute the `my_function` function on your smart contract and return the result.\n\n### Step 4: Optimize Your WASM Code\n\nTo optimize your WASM code for deployment to Iroha, you can use tools like `wasm-opt` or `twiggy`. These tools can help reduce the size of your WASM binary and improve its performance.\n\nFor example:\n```bash\n$ wasm-opt -Os -o optimized.wasm my_contract.wasm\n```\nThis will optimize your WASM code using the `wasm-opt` tool and output a new file named `optimized.wasm`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nUsing WebAssembly (WASM) in Iroha allows you to deploy smart contracts written in languages like Rust, C++, or Go. By following these steps, you can compile your code to WASM, deploy it to the Iroha network, and interact with it using the `iroha` command-line tool. Additionally, you can optimize your WASM code for deployment to Iroha using tools like `wasm-opt` or `twiggy`."}
