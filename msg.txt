Hello Anuj
How are you
Anuj — Yesterday at 16:05
Hi
I am good
Thanks
How are you?
Portdex — Yesterday at 16:06
I m good, I have a Rust task, can you do that
its a service creation for signing transaction to the iroha network
Anuj — Yesterday at 16:07
Yesterday I had a meeting with Raj and I was showing demo during the demonstration I found a bug so I walked that part and fixed that
Portdex — Yesterday at 16:07
I have not heard about the perivious work given to you
Anuj — Yesterday at 16:07
Can I show you that work after 15 minutes
Portdex — Yesterday at 16:07
Okay, call us then in the group
Anuj — Yesterday at 16:13
Okay
Anuj — Yesterday at 17:01
Also I need more details about Rust service like -
will it be as an individual or in Iroha repo ?
Complete functionality
Cost also

You are a hybrid AI shopping and local discovery assistant.

Your primary goal is to answer user queries instantly (within a few seconds) by combining:
1) Pre-indexed knowledge from a vector database (ChromaDB)
2) Real-time web search results from search APIs (e.g., Tavily, SerpAPI, Bing, Google Places)

It appears you’ve been by yourself in this call for more than 3 minutes. The bandwidth patrol has asked me to disconnect you to save bandwidth. That stuff doesn’t grow on trees!
Only you can see this • Dismiss message

Also do not forgot to give me a AWS /GC account
where i can use service and deploy the code.

Excellent question — this is where many people design it wrong.

You have:

🕸 crawl4AI → scraped text

🖼 Images

🏷 Metadata

🧠 ChromaDB (vector store)

☁ Possibly S3

You’re asking:

Where should metadata and images be stored? In Chroma or S3?

Let’s design it properly.

🔥 Short Answer
Data Type	Store In
Text chunks	ChromaDB
Embeddings	ChromaDB
Small metadata	ChromaDB
Images	S3 (or object storage)
Large metadata	S3 or main database

Chroma is not object storage.

🧠 What ChromaDB Is For

ChromaDB is a:

Vector database optimized for embedding search.

It stores:

embeddings

small text chunks

lightweight metadata (filters)

It is NOT meant for:

Images (binary blobs)

Large JSON documents

File storage

Video/audio

🏗 Proper Architecture
crawl4AI
   ↓
Extract:
   - text
   - images
   - metadata


Then store:

Images → S3
Full document JSON → S3 (optional)
Embeddings + chunked text → Chroma
Structured metadata → DB (Postgres)

🖼 Where to Store Images

Always:

Store images in S3 (or equivalent object storage).

Examples:

AWS S3

Cloudflare R2

GCP Storage

MinIO (self-hosted)

Store only:

URL reference in Chroma metadata

Example:

collection.add({
  documents: [textChunk],
  embeddings: [vector],
  metadatas: [{
     sourceUrl: "example.com",
     imageUrl: "https://s3.bucket/image123.jpg",
     category: "fashion"
  }]
})

🧠 Where to Store Metadata

Depends on size.

Small metadata (OK in Chroma)

Examples:

source URL

author

category

timestamp

user ID

Store in Chroma metadata.

Large structured metadata

If metadata is big JSON:

Store in:

PostgreSQL

MongoDB

Or S3 JSON file

And reference ID in Chroma.

🚨 Why Not Store Images in Chroma?

Because:

Chroma stores vectors

Binary storage bloats memory

Slows search

Increases cost

Not optimized for blobs

Vector DB ≠ object store.

🧠 What About Image Embeddings?

If you want image search:

Generate image embeddings (CLIP or similar)

Store image embedding in Chroma

Store actual image in S3

Link via metadata

Example:

{
  id: "img_123",
  embedding: [...],
  metadata: {
    s3Url: "...",
    type: "image"
  }
}

🏗 Recommended Production Architecture
               ┌────────────┐
               │   S3       │
               │ images +   │
               │ full docs  │
               └────────────┘
                      ↑
                      │
crawl4AI → chunk text │
                      ↓
               ┌────────────┐
               │ ChromaDB   │
               │ embeddings │
               │ + metadata │
               └────────────┘

🧠 Multi-Tenant SaaS Tip

Add:

userId in Chroma metadata

bucket per user or folder per user in S3

Example:

s3://bucket/user_123/images/img1.jpg

⚠️ Common Mistakes

❌ Storing full HTML in Chroma
❌ Storing base64 images in Chroma
❌ Not chunking text
❌ Not separating storage layers
❌ No metadata filtering

🚀 If You're Building AI Agents (Important)

You should:

Use Chroma only for retrieval

Use Postgres for structured knowledge

Use S3 for file assets

Keep vector layer lean

📌 Final Answer

Store text embeddings and small searchable metadata in ChromaDB, but store images and large documents in S3 (or object storage), and reference them via metadata links in Chroma.
